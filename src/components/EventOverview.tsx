            TechTrove 2.0 is the ADP Cyber Circuit Club's flagship competitive eventâ€”a 2-day, 
            24-hour hackathon that challenges the brightest minds on campus to build a working 
            prototype from scratch. This intense event is designed to foster innovation, test 
            real-world problem-solving skills, and celebrate the spirit of creation under pressure.

            On the morning of Day 1, all teams will be presented with a set of real-world problem 
            statements. Your challenge is to choose one and, over the next 24 hours, develop a 
            functional technical solution.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Teams are allowed to use any technology they wish, but the project must be built from 
            scratch during the event. While teams will work remotely overnight, the on-site sessions 
            are crucial for collaboration, mentorship, and final preparations.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            At the end of the event, each team must submit their project via GitHub for judging.
